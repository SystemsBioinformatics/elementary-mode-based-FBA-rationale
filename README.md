Code that uses Elementary Conversion Mode computation to obtain all relevant conversions for a constraint-based optimisation problem, i.e., all possible optimal yields between the constrained nutrients and the objective function.

### Create a conda environment with necessary packages
Open a conda command prompt in elevated mode and change the directory to where EM_based_FBA_rationale.yml is located. Then run the following code: conda env create -f EM_based_FBA_rationale.yml, which will create a conda environment for you.

Activate your new environment with conda activate EM_based_FBA_rationale
